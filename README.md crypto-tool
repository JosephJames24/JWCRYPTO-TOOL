The jwcrypto-tool is a tool used for encryption nand decryption using various algorithms such as AES,DES,3DES,RC4 and RSA.

How to Use jwcrypto-tool script
1. Save the Script: Copy the above script into a file named "simple_crypto.sh*.
2. Make it Executable: Run the following command to make the script executable:
text chmod +x simple_crypto.sh
3. Create a Key File: For symmetric encryption algorithms (AES, DES, 3DES, RC4), create a text file containing the password or key.
4. Run the Script: Execute the script:
text * ./simple_crypto.sh
5. Follow the Prompts: The script will guide you through selecting an action (encrypt or decrypt and an algorithm. You will then be prompted to enter the input file, output file, and key file.

How to Decrypt the file
If you want to decrypt the file later, you would follow similar steps:
1. Run the script again.
2. Choose *2' for Decrypt.
3. Choose '1' for AES.
4. Enter encrypted.enc for the input file.
5. Enter "decrypted. txt* for the output file.
6. Enter 'key. txt for the key file.
The script will then decrypt the file and create "decrypted. txt* with the original content.

Features of the jwcrypto-tool Script
* User-Friendly Interface: The script provides a clear menu for selecting actions and algorithms.
* Interactive Prompts: Users are prompijed for necessary inputs, making it easier to
use.
* Looping Menu: After completing an operation, the user can choose to perform another action or exit.
